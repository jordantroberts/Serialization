# Serialization Practice

Following the process outlined in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/how-to-write-object-data-to-an-xml-file">the Microsoft Serialization documentation</a> to learn how to write and read object data to and from an XML file and gain a better understanding of how serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes in order to store that object or transmit it to memory, a database or a file.

The main purpose of serialization is to save the state of an object in order to be able to recreate it when needed. The reverse process is called deserialization.
